#Title 

GitHub - Part 2 - Basic Workflow

#Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to practice the workflow that allows you to make changes to a code base that is living on GitHub.

#Description

The purpose of this README.md is to go through the red steps of the asignment which were split in 6 seperate steps

#Step 1

In this part we add a comment of our choice to our helloworld.c file we made before hand and then commit the changes. We first put the command, "git add helloworld.c" in order to start the process of step 1. Then we follow with " git commit - m "Added comment to helloworld.c" in order to show the added comment to the file and show the change as well

#Step 2 

In this step I push my change onto the GitHib server and the effect of it is that it change in the branch of hellowoorld on the terminal and is reflected in the branch helloworld on the server. So you use the command git push origin helloworld and something should output. 

#Step 3

In this step I pull request merge. I created a pull request in the git server and then got it evaluated. Then the changed merged into the main branch. It a process on git hub where you do it and confirm the merge. There is a button where you creat a pull request and click the "Merge pull request". Made sure not to delete the branch and then on to the next step


#Step 4 
In this step I first used "git checkout main" in order to switch the branch to main and its up to date. Then "git pull origin main" for the next step of the process and then it will ask for your password and username for clarification to let the process happen but instead I putting my password I pit a access token which is a new procces to be done then it shall output something

#Step 5

In step 5 we do two things that need to be done which are "git checkout helloworld" which switched to branch 'helloworld'. Then 'git merge main' that updates the file. 

#Step 6

The final step you then put the command "git push origin helloworld" which updates the whole thing and then you are done! We successfully finished one complete cycle workflow where something out puts
